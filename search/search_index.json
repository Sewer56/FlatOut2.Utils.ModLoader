About FlatOut 2 Mod Loader is a Reloaded II based solution for loading mods. Usage guide here. Features Load custom unpacked files from Reloaded II mods (even with packed game!!). Load custom BFSes from your mods. Log all file loads. Log all replaced file loads. Improves load times for all files. Adds support for ZStd compressed BFSes for smaller size + better loads. Improved read speeds of content in BFS. Building Install Reloaded II . Install .NET 7 SDK . [Optional] Download Visual Studio/Rider and open the .sln file. When you build your project, the files will automatically be copied to the right directory and be loaded by Reloaded.

Warning The BFS files produced by this method are incompatible with unmodified vanilla game. The FlatOut 2 Mod Loader makes use of custom BFS files, with a better compression algorithm (ZStd) that provides significant improvement in the speed of loading files from disk. More specifically, these BFS files are on average 75% of the size with data decompressed at around ~214% speed, compared to the unmodified files; leading to improved load times, especially on SSDs. This guide shows how to repack game's stock BFS files to use the new improved BFSes, and merge them into a single BFS. Download The Tools Info Download my fork of BfsTool . Unpacking Game Files Info Here we merge multiple BFSes into single data folder. Go to your game folder and drag files [in your game folder] over extract-fo2-bfs.bat in the following order: fo2a.bfs fo2b.bfs fo2c.bfs patch1.bfs After unpacking all files you should have a data folder around 4GB. Repacking Game Files Info Repacking will take a while. Don't be impatient. Once unpacked, drag the data folder over build-fo2-modloader-bfs.bat . This will produce a file called data.bfs . Delete the original BFS files listed in unpacking section. Open filesystem file with a hex editor, and modify it so it looks like this: data.bfs Open patch file and remove line with patch1.bfs . If this results in empty file, delete the file. Result Your game folder should resemble something like the following:","title":"Improving Load Times"},{"location":"improve-loads/#improving-load-times","text":"Info This procedure provides the following benefits: - Approx. 500MB Saved Drive Space. - Improved file load times by ~2x. - Cleans up game folder.

And replace your FlatOut2.exe with the Polish/GOG/DRM Free version . Create a Reloaded Mod Follow the guidance in the Reloaded wiki to create a new Reloaded mod. Download Mod Loader If you don't have it already, download the FlatOut 2 Mod Loader Mod from the Download Mods section. Set Dependency on Mod Loader In the Edit Mod menu (right click your mod in mods list) we're going to add FlatOut 2 Mod Loader as a dependency. Adding a 'dependency' to your mod will make it such that Mod Loader will always be loaded when your mod is loaded. This is a necessary step. Developing Your Mod Info For developing mods, ModLoader supports loading of files directly stored in your mod folder(s). Warning Please note that files loaded this way have priority over any files loaded from BFS archives, regardless of mod order. As such, loading loose files is intended for development only. Open Mod Folder Go to the folder where your mod is stored, this can be done by simply clicking the Open Folder button. Adding Your Files Make a folder called Files , and inside that folder place your stuff. A mod that replaces the splash/copyright screen at game boot would now look as follows: // Mod Contents ModConfig.json Preview.png Files \u2514\u2500data \u2514\u2500menu \u2514\u2500copyright.tga The connectors \u2514\u2500 represent folders. Releasing your Mods Pack Your Mod Info To release mods, you should pack them into .bfs files, as this will improve load times. Use my fork of BfsTool , and drag your mod's data over build-fo2-modloader-bfs.bat . Make a folder called BFS , and inside that folder place your BFS files. Once you put your BFS files there, remove the original Files folder. The contents of our mod folder would now look as follows. // Mod Contents ModConfig.json Preview.png BFS \u2514\u2500selo.bfs The connectors \u2514\u2500 represent folders. Note When multiple BFS files are found in the folder, they will be loaded in alphabetical order. i.e. 00_menus.bfs will be loaded before 01_music.bfs because 00 comes before 01 . Publish Your Mod Info You should both Enable Update Support AND Publish according to the guidelines. It is recommended to enable update support even if you don't plan to ship updates as doing so will allow your mod to be used in Mod Packs. Please refer to the Reloaded wiki . For bigger (> 100MiB) updates, consider using Delta Updates to keep download sizes for users updating your mod small. Note Creating deltas for 1GB+ files might take a few minutes, please be patient.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#creating-your-mod","text":"Info If you don't already have it installed, install Reloaded-II [installs to desktop].
